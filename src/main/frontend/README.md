This directory contains the [React](https://react.dev/) code for the web application frontend.  The following technologies are used:

* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Context](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context)
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)
* [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/)
* [Ant Design](https://ant.design/)
* [dndkit](https://dndkit.com/)

## Running Locally

As this application was bootstrapped by [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/), the standard commands defined by that framework can be used to run the frontend code in a local browser.

* `npm start` runs the app in development mode at http://localhost:3000.
* `npm test` runs the unit tests.
* `npm run build` generates a production binary.
